# [Quality Diversity through Human Feedback: Towards Open-Ended Diversity-Driven Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12103)


ID: Issue #105

## Summary

This paper explores an approach that combines QD algorithms with progressively inferring diveristy metrics from human feedback of similarity among solutions. QDHF offers greater flexibility compared to manually designing diversity metrics and outperforms unsupervised methods by leveraging diversity metrics.

## Questions

Can this method be somehow useful for QD data selecton (apart from generation) of LLMs?
