# [Rethinking and Refining the Distinct Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13587)

ID: #327

## Summary

The aim of the paper is to improve the so called "Distict" metric proposed few years ago in another paper. The Distinct
metric is also what is called token type ratio, which is the ratio of unique tokens over all the tokens present in the text. The paper presents the limitations of the distinct metric like the sensitivity to length, that is shorter texts can have higher distinct scores while longer can have lower ones due to the repetition of tokens. The new proposed refined metric called expectation-adjusted distinct (EAD) is the number of distinct tokens divided by the expectation of distinct/unique tokens.
Empirical evaluations show that this metric correlates more with human judgements.
