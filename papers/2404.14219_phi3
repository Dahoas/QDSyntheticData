## Summary

Report on Phi-3-mini, (3.8 billion parameters so small enough to fit on a phone, trained on 3.3 trillion tokens), Phi-3-small (7 billion parameters trained for 4.8T tokens - same data but more epochs), 
Phi-3-medium (14 billion parameters trained for 4.8T tokens - again same data but more epochs), and phi-3-vision (a 4.2 billion parameter model based on phi-3-mini). 
They claim Phi-3-mini reaches the level of highly capable models such as GPT-3.5 or Mixtral with only 3.8B total parameters. 
(while Mixtral has 45B total parameters for example).
The innovation lies entirely in the dataset for training, a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered
publicly available web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format.

## Relevance to survey topic (1-5)

Relevance: 2 (not much details on synthetic data generation, or Q&D)

## Algorithms

## Benchmarks

See section 3 (page 4), 11 for VLM. 

Phi-3-mini rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38
on MT-bench).

## Other comments

Pre-training is performed in two disjoint and sequential phases;
phase-1 comprises mostly of web sources aimed at teaching the model general knowledge and language
understanding. Phase-2 merges even more heavily filtered webdata (a subset used in Phase-1) with some
synthetic data that teach the model logical reasoning and various niche skills.
