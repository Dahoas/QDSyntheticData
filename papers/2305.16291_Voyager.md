# [Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291)

ID: 116

## Summary

Voyager is a lifelong learning agent, for the open-ended world of Minecraft. 
It continuously explores, acquires diverse skills, and makes novel discoveries *without human intervention*. 
It consists of 3 components: 
1. A curriculum is automatically generated from an LLM (suggests new subgoals to pursue at a particular environment state). 
2. An iterative prompting mechanism that is taken where the goal is to write a piece of executable code representing this subgoal. This means no human intervention is required. 
3. A skill library stores previously-generated pieces of code for later use.

## Other comments

Voyager interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries (no need for model parameter fine-tuning). 
The progressively more difficult curriculum is generated by GPT-4 based on the overarching goal of “discovering as many diverse things as possible”.
This approach can be perceived as an in-context form of novelty search. 
LLMs struggle to produce the correct action code consistently in one shot, hence the iterative prompting step. 
Instead of manually coding success checkers for each new task proposed by the automatic curriculum, they instantiate another GPT-4 agent for self-verification. 
This is is more comprehensive than self-reflection. 

Comparisons are made with existing LLM approaches that focus on self-reflection / inference-time refinement.
