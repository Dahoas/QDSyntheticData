# [Beyond Scale: the Diversity Coefficient as a Data Quality Metric Demonstrates LLMs are Pre-trained on Formally Diverse Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13840)

## Summary

Introduces a new metric for measuring (general text) dataset diversity. Evaluates this metric and shows it has a number of intuition-following properties and demonstrates datasets such as the Pile are diverse, and proposes it as a means to measure dataset quality.

## Relevance to survey topic (1-5)

Relevance: 3

## Algorithms

- Diversity Coefficient (metric): generate gradients from GPT-2 on a batch, compute Fisher Information Matrix, take diagonal, compute average cosine similarity between these embeddings


## Benchmarks

Evaluates diversity score on: 

- Pile, C4, Wikitext-103, Pile-CC, HackerNews, NIH, PubMed, USPTO, OpenWebText, SlimPajama

## Metric Results

- The defined metric is used to measure diversity and claimed to have implications for data usefulness / quality.
