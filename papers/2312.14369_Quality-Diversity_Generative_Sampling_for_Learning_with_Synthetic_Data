# [Quality-Diversity Generative Sampling for Learning with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14369)

ID: 257

## Summary

Generative models can create synthetic training datasets, but may transfer biases to downstream tasks. 
They propose quality-diversity generative sampling (QDGS), a framework for sampling data uniformly across a user-defined measure space, despite the data coming from a biased generator. 
It focuses on protecting quality and diversity when generating synthetic training datasets.
