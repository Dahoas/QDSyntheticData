# [Quality-Diversity Generative Sampling for Learning with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14369)

ID: 257

## Summary

Problem: Generative models can create synthetic training datasets, but may transfer biases to downstream tasks. 

They propose quality-diversity generative sampling (QDGS), a framework for sampling balanced data from biased generative models, across a user-defined measure space. 
It focuses on protecting quality and diversity when generating synthetic training datasets.
QDGS increases spread over desired attributes, described by user-defined language prompts, by exploring high dimensionality latent spaces.

## Relevance to survey topic (1-5)

Relevance: 5

## Algorithms

- CMA-MAEGA (Covariance matrix adaptation map-annealing)

## Benchmarks

Tasks evaluated.

- Synthetic dataset of shapes and colours as proof of concept - repaired biases in shape classifiers.
- Generating synthetic images of faces with a diverse range of skin colours and ages - more uniform spread of synthetic facial image training data resulting in improved accuracy on dark-skinned faces.

## Metric Results

- How is quality measured?
- How is diversity measured? Measure functions m_j computes CLIP scores (Equation 2) to determine the measures of diversity in the resulting images. 
- Fine-tuning results?
