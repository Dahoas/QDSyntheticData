# [Scaling Scaling Laws with Board Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03113)

## Summary

This paper shows that the performance of AlphaGo on Hex can be predicted as a function of compute and board size. While performance vs. compute is a classical relation to consider when deriving scaling laws, performance vs. problem size is a novel type of scaling law that might be interesting to consider more generally.
