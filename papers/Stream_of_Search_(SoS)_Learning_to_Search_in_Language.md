# [Stream of Search (SoS): Learning to Search in Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03683)

## Summary

Trains a small LLM on synthetically generated solutions to Countdown (a generalization of 24) generated by a diverse set of solution heuristics. A comparison to a dataset of optimal paths reveals training on sub-optimal data generalizes far better. RL algorithms (STaR and APA) can be applied for additional improvement. Notably, APA slightly outperforms STaR.
