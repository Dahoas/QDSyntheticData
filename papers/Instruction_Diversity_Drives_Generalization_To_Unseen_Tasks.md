# [Instruction Diversity Drives Generalization To Unseen Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10891)


## Summary

Investigates generalization of string rewriting instruction tasks as a function of dataset diversity. Finds diversity significantly affects generalization, and non-uniformity in distribution can be mitigated by more diversity. A very sharp phase transition seems to happen whenever the model sees over 400 types of instructions. The number of actual samples per instruction seems to matter less.
