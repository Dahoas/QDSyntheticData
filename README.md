# QD Synthetic Data

This repository serves as the main organizational tool for the [survey paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tvvwqwxmqdvf#e3f33) "A Survey of Methods for Generating Quality and Diverse Synthetic Data with LLMs". We are collecting papers as Github issues with the tag `Paper`. To add a new paper, first check that it is not present, then fill out the new paper issue template [here](https://github.com/Dahoas/QDSyntheticData/issues/new/choose). To close the issue you (or someone else) can make a PR containing a report on the paper using the provided format [here](./paper_example.md). You can find a roadmap for the project on [this](https://github.com/users/Dahoas/projects/7/views/1) Github projects board. Weekly meeting notes and recordings are housed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q0Np8xaJgcvqMSt_5PDl-M6MyrfWjtjN?usp=sharing).

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to catalog the many current ad hoc methods for synthetic data generation via LLMs with a focus on understanding their impact on two metrics: dataset quality and dataset diversity. Ideally, this can be done under a single conceptual framework. An important sub-question we will need to discuss is how to appropriately define these metrics, in particular dataset diversity. 

Overall, this will roughly consist of three stages:
1. **Collection**: finding as many papers as we can pertaining to synthetic data generation and measures of and techniques improving quality or diversity for LLMs.
2. **Synthesis**: writing a survey of our findings by organizing methods into a single conceptual framework. We may also want to do some benchmarking.
3. **Next steps**: identifying promising research directions as recommendations to the broader community

## Questions

Some important questions we will want to think about addressing:

- How to define quality?
- How to define diversity?
- The impact of the model
  - model size
  - pretraining data
  - fine-tuning data
- The impact of the sampling methodology
  - Type of prompt
  - Sampling algorithm
- Impact of the task domain
